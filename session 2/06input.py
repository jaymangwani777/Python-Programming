# a = input("enter number 1")
a = int(input("enter number 1"))
# now we are converting string into integer means the number which is in string form we are converting it in an actuall number!

# b =input("enter number 2")
b =int(input("enter number 2"))

print("number a is:", a)
print("number b is:", b)
print("sum is", a+b)
# what is happening in this prograam is the the numbers are in the string form when we try add the string or when we try to add + sign between two string it concadinates means they get put together!

# now they are converted into integers now we can see the actuall sum!

# these are type conversions!
