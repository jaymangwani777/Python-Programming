# Write a python program to display a user entered name followed by Good
# Afternoon using input () function.

username=input("enter your name: ")
# goodafternoon="goodafternoon"

# print("the name of the user is followed by",username+goodafternoon)

# that was a doable approach but not efficient

print("good afternoon",username)

# you can also do this by like this

print(f"good afternoon{username}")
